- Check backend's database first to be sure that it is an actual frontend issue
- Double check that you're receiving the proper data in the Network tab 🏅
- `console.log`, or even better: use the debugger if your call stack is complex
- Aim to your Vue devtools and check the state there
- Some extension maybe? Try a private window 🕵️
- If using Vue2, be aware of some [Change Detection Caveats](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html#Change-Detection-Caveats) (solved in Vue3! 💪)
- Still nothing...? 🤔
- Try Firefox/Chrome, errors may be different or either specific to one browser
- Clear NPM/yarn caches + `node_modules` and reinstall your project
- Take a shower/walk or relax with a smoothie 🍹🏖️ (and come back at it! 🥊)
- Ask a buddy if he/she can reproduce your issue
- Reach us on [Nuxt Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ps2h6QT) 🤠, [Github discussions](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/discussions) 🗣️ or [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nuxt.js) 👐
